# Two player ScoreKeeper using HTML, CSS and JS

### Principle

This simple project uses basic front end tech stack to create a two player game. 
1. The HTML file has the markup for buttons that control two players and a reset button to reset the game. 
2. The CSS file has styles for all the individual elements in HTML file. 
3. The logic is as follows:
    * The max score limit is calculated using the input provided by user. 
    * Both players can take turns now. 
    * The player who reaches the top score is acknowledged the winner. 
    * To distinguish the result color property is used. 
    * The players can reset the game and start from begining.
